# Hi there 👋

**I’m Taha.**  
I like building things that make life easier (or at least less annoying). Lately, that’s meant **developing AI workflows to automate repetitive tasks** so I can focus on more creative projects. I’m an undergraduate at **Columbia University** studying computer science with a focus on **artificial intelligence and machine learning**. I’m particularly interested in **quantitative development** and **software engineering**.
